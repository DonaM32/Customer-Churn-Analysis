This project explores a sample customer subscription dataset to identify churn patterns and uncover actionable insights. Using Excel, the analysis applies pivot tables, calculated fields, and visualizations to summarize churn behavior by city, subscription type, and monthly revenue trends.

Project Objectives

* Identify the number of churned vs. active customers.
* Analyze churn rate by city, subscription type, and month.
* Highlight monthly revenue trends.
* Create a visual dashboard for executive insights.

💡 Key Metrics (KPIs)

* Total Customers: 20
* Churned Customers: 12
* Active Customers: 8
